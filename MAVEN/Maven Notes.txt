Maven is Build Automation Tool..Generates Build
No need to download and configure the jar files into our project (like for selenium,TestNG,Apache poi etc.,) .. 
All these jars can be used in the form of dependencies which are present in Maven Centralized repository over internet
For eg: Thought works people has kept the Selenium dependencies into the Maven Centralized repository
Maven will send the request to the centralized repository in the form of dependencies.
In Dependencies we have 3 attributes : groupId,artifactID and version number
All the dependencies downloaded from the Maven centralized repository gets stored locally in .m2 repository
Maven repository can be created private to specific companies
